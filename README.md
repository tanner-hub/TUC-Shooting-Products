# TUC-Shooting-Products

**These projects were developed in my free time as a hobbyist using a Raspberry Pi**

## Flip.py

>Flip is a small, automated target training system that is designed to rotate a two-sided target so that a user is presented with side 1, side 2, or no target positions.

## Horizon.py

>Horizon was an addition made to this system that allowed lateral movement using an additional motor, a suspended pulley, and wire.

*The aspect that made this project unique is the implementation of python rand libraries so that the servos could move the target in an unpredictable manner*
